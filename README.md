# State management comparison

## Getting started

Implementation of all the state managements can be found in [lib/state_managements](https://github.com/Jan-Stepien/state_management_comparison/tree/main/lib/state_managements) directory.

## Purpose

This project is made to provide insight on different state management implementation approaches provided by Flutter in [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options):

- [X] [Provider](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#provider)

- [X] [Riverpod](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#riverpod)

- [X] [setState](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#setstate)

- [X] [InheritedWidget & InheritedModel](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#inheritedwidget--inheritedmodel)

Every page selectable from the drawer shows the same UI implementation which only difference is used state management.
